Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications such as web, Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows from a single codebase.

Flutter was first described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017


#### Features
1. Fast

Flutter code compiles to ARM or Intel machine code as well as JavaScript, for fast performance on any device.

2. Productive

Build and iterate quickly with Hot Reload. Update code and see changes almost instantly, without losing state.

3. Flexible

Control every pixel to create customized, adaptive designs that look and feel great on any screen.


#### Using Dart and Flutter Together
If youâ€™re actively learning Flutter, learning Dart programming as well would be a great skill to add to your toolset. Leveraging Dart and Flutter together enables developers to build high-quality, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, which can save you development time and improve your appâ€™s performance. Learn how Pieces, an AI-enabled productivity tool across macOS, Windows and Linux with plugins across the entire development workflow, used these frameworks to build their products in their Dart and Flutter case study.

#### What are the Prerequisites to Learn Flutter?

You should have basic knowledge of a Dart programming language.
