# Row Widget In Flutter
In Flutter, Row widget displays its children horizontally. It is very useful when placing UI side by side. This is one of the most used widget in flutter.

*Example 1: Row In Flutter*

In this example, the Row contains three children widgets which are Icon, Text, and Icon.


```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: const Row(
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
            Text('I am learning flutter'),
            Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

*Example 2: Create Rating Bar Using Flutter*

In this example, you will learn to build star rating bar using row widget.


```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: const Row(
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.yellow),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Row Properties
These are the most common useful properties of the Row widget which helps you control the layout of its children:

| Property |	Description |
| --- | --- |
| mainAxisAlignment	 | Determines how the children are aligned horizontally. |
| crossAxisAlignment	| Determines how the children are aligned vertically. |
| children	| The widgets that are displayed inside the row. |


### Main Axis In Row
In Row, main axis determines how the children are aligned horizontally. The mainAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

| MainAxisAlignment Values	| Description | 
| --- | --- |
| MainAxisAlignment.start	| Children are aligned at the start of the horizontal axis. |
| MainAxisAlignment.end	| Children are aligned at the end of the horizontal axis. |
| MainAxisAlignment.center	| Children are centered along the horizontal axis. |
| MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween	| Children have equal spacing between them. |
| MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround	| Children have equal spacing between them, and also the space at the start and the end is divided evenly. |
MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly	| Children have equal spacing before, between, and after them. |


*Example 3: Main Axis Alignment *

In this example, you see 5 stars which are in center horizontally. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, spaceBetween, spaceAround or spaceEvenly.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: const Row(
          // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceBetween", "spaceAround" or "spaceEvenly"
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.yellow),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

> Note: By default mainAxisAlignment value is mainAxisAlignment.start

### Cross Axis In Row
In Row, cross axis determines how the children are aligned vertically. The crossAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

| CrossAxisAlignment Values	| Description |
| --- | --- |
| CrossAxisAlignment.start	| Children are aligned at the top of the Row. |
| CrossAxisAlignment.end	| Children are aligned at the bottom of the Row. |
| CrossAxisAlignment.center	| Children are vertically centered in the Row. |
| CrossAxisAlignment.stretch	| Children are forced to fill the available space vertically. |
| CrossAxisAlignment.baseline | Children are aligned by their baseline (useful for text). |


*Example 4: Cross Axis Alignment*
In this example, you see 5 stars which are in center vertically. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, stretch, baseline.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: const Row(
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.yellow),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

> Note: By default crossAxisAlignment value is crossAxisAlignment.center

*Example 5: Using Main Axis & Cross Axis Alignment*

In this example, you see 5 stats which are in center horizontally and vertically. Run this code online and try changing its main axis and cross axis alignement.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: const Row(
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround" or "spaceEvenly"
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.yellow),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Overflow Issue
When you put too many widgets inside a Row and they can’t fit within the screen, you’ll get an overflow error. Here are simple ways to handle this overflow issue in Flutter:

- Wrap in SingleChildScrollView widget
- Use Expanded or Flexible widget
- Example 6: Wrap In SingleChildScrollView
- When you have many children widgets, and they can’t all fit on the screen, you might want to scroll to see the ones that are out of view. For more see the example below:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
            child: Row(
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
              children: List.generate(
                  50, (index) => const Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow)),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```


*Example 7: Using Expanded*

In a Row, use Expanded to make a widget take up all the available remaining space within its parent widget. For more, see the example below:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: Row(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) =>  const Expanded(
                    child: Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

*Example 8: Using Flexible*

Flexible allows a widget within a Row to fit its content but won’t exceed its maximum size, even if there’s extra space available. For more, see the example below:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: Row(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) => const Flexible(
                    fit: FlexFit.loose,
                    child: Icon(Icons.star,  color: Colors.yellow))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```


> Note: Expanded forces its child to fill available space, while Flexible allows its child to occupy space without necessarily filling it.
