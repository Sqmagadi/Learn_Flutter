# Column Widget In Flutter
In Flutter, Column widget displays its children vertically. It is very useful when placing UI top to bottom. This is one of the most used widgets in Flutter.

*Example 1: Column In Flutter*

In this example, the Column contains three children widgets which are Icon, Text, and Icon.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: const Column(
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
            Text('I am learning flutter'),
            Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

*Example 2: Create Container Boxes*

In this example, you will learn to build 4 different containers inside the Column.


```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

**Column Properties**

These are the most common useful properties of the Column widget which help you control the layout of its children:

| Property	|Description|
| ---|---|
| mainAxisAlignment|	Determines how the children are aligned vertically.|
| crossAxisAlignment|	Determines how the children are aligned horizontally.|
| children|	The widgets that are displayed inside the column.|

#### Main Axis In Column
In Column, the main axis determines how the children are aligned vertically. The mainAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

|MainAxisAlignment Values|	Description|
|---|---|
|MainAxisAlignment.start	|Children are aligned at the start of the vertical axis.|
|MainAxisAlignment.end	|Children are aligned at the end of the vertical axis.|
|MainAxisAlignment.center	|Children are centered along the vertical axis.|
|MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween	|Children have equal spacing between them.|
|MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround	|Children have equal spacing between them, and also the space at the start and the end is divided evenly.|
|MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly	|Children have equal spacing before, between, and after them.|

*Example 3: Main Axis Alignment*

In this example, you see 4 containers which are centered vertically. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, spaceBetween, spaceAround or spaceEvenly.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceBetween", "spaceAround" or "spaceEvenly"
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```


> Note: By default mainAxisAlignment value is mainAxisAlignment.start

#### Cross Axis In Column
In Column, the cross axis determines how the children are aligned horizontally. The crossAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

|CrossAxisAlignment Values|	Description|
|---|---|
|CrossAxisAlignment.start	|Children are aligned at the left of the Column.|
|CrossAxisAlignment.end	|Children are aligned at the right of the Column.|
|CrossAxisAlignment.center	|Children are vertically centered in the Column.|
|CrossAxisAlignment.stretch	|Children are forced to fill the available space horizontally.|
|CrossAxisAlignment.baseline	|Children are aligned by their baseline (useful for text).|


*Example 4: Cross Axis Alignment*

In this example, you see 4 boxes which are centered horizontally. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, stretch, or baseline.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: Column(
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch", or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

> Note: By default crossAxisAlignment value is crossAxisAlignment.center

*Example 5: Using Main Axis & Cross Axis Alignment*

In this example, you see 4 containers which are aligned vertically in the center. Run this code online and try changing its main axis and cross axis alignment.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
            child: Column(
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
              children: List.generate(
                  50, (index) => Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  )),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

**Overflow Issue**

When you put too many widgets inside a Column and they can’t fit within the screen, you’ll get an overflow error. Here are simple ways to handle this overflow issue in Flutter:

- Wrap in SingleChildScrollView widget
- Use Expanded or Flexible widget


*Example 6: Wrap In SingleChildScrollView*

When you have many children widgets, and they can’t all fit on the screen, you might want to scroll to see the ones that are out of view. For more see the example below:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
            child: Column(
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
              children: List.generate(
                  50, (index) => Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  )),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```


*Example 7: Using Expanded*

In a Column, use Expanded to make a widget take up all the available remaining space within its parent widget. For more, see the example below:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: Column(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) => Expanded(
                    child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  ))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```


*Example 8: Using Flexible*

Flexible allows a widget within a Column to fit its content but won’t exceed its maximum size, even if there’s extra space available. For more, see the example below:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: Column(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) => Flexible(
                    fit: FlexFit.loose,
                    child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  ))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```


> Note: Expanded forces its child to fill available space, while Flexible allows its child to occupy space without necessarily filling it.
