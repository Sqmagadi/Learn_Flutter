# WIDGETS IN FLUTTER
**What is Flutter Widgets?**

In Flutter, everything on the screen is a widget. Flutter widgets are the UI elements that you see on the screen e.g. button, text, image, list, etc. Widgets can be either stateful or stateless.

#### Types of Widgets in Flutter
Flutter widgets are broadly categorized into:

1. Stateless Widget
2. Stateful Widget


#### 1. Stateless Widget

Stateless widgets are immutable. Once you define their properties, they remain constant and don’t change. They are the go-to choice for displaying static content like text, images, or icons.


> Note: You can use `stl` shortcut to create a stateless widget in VS Code.

*Example of a Stateless Widget:*

```
class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;

  MyStatelessWidget({required this.text});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(text);
  }
}
```

#### 2.Stateful Widget
Stateful widgets are dynamic and can change during their lifecycle, usually in response to user interactions or real-time data updates. They are essential for content that evolves over time, such as a shopping cart’s contents.


> Note: You can use `stf` shortcut to create a stateful widget in VS Code.

*Example of a Stateful Widget:*

```
class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
  int counter = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        setState(() {
          counter++;
        });
      },
      child: Text('You have pressed the button $counter times.'),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Stateless Vs Stateful Widgets
|  | Stateless Widgets	| Stateful Widgets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Properties	| Stateless widgets remain constant and don’t change	| Stateful widgets can change their appearance based on events or data. |
| Use Case	| For static content (e.g., buttons, icons)	| For dynamic content (e.g., user interactions) |
| State	| No internal state	| Maintains internal state that can be updated |
| Rebuild	| Entire widget tree rebuilt on state changes	| Rebuilds only the widget affected by state change |


#### Most Used Flutter Widgets
- **Text**: It is used to display text on the screen.
- **Container**: It is used to display a rectangular box on the screen.
- **Row**: It is used to display widgets in a horizontal manner.
- **Column**: It is used to display widgets in a vertical manner.
- **Stack**: It is used to display widgets on top of each other.


> Note: You can use Container widget to add padding, margin, border, background color, etc. to other widgets.
