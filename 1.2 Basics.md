# Basic Flutter Program


1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to create a new Flutter project:

`flutter create my_first_app`

Navigate to the new project directory:

`cd my_first_app`

3. Understand the Project Structure

- **lib/main.dart**: This is the main file of your Flutter app. You'll write your app's code here.
- **pubspec.yaml**: This file contains metadata about your app, such as dependencies.
- **android and ios folders**: These folders contain platform-specific code.

4. Write Your First Flutter App

Open `lib/main.dart` in your IDE.

Replace the existing code with the following code for a simple app:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My First Flutter App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Basic Flutter Program Explained**

- The `import ‘package:flutter/material.dart’;` means we’re using the Material design package from Flutter.
- The `void main() {…}` function is where every Flutter application starts.
- The `runApp(…);` function is how we initialize and launch the app’s UI.
- The `MaterialApp` widget is our foundation for creating Material Design apps in Flutter.
- The `Scaffold` widget provides a basic visual structure, like a canvas, to design our app upon.
- The `AppBar` widget is like the top bar of an app, where we can place a title or action buttons.
- The `Text` widget is simply for displaying text on the screen.
- The `Center` widget centers the child widget.


5. Run the App

Set up an emulator or connect a physical device:

For **Android**: Use an Android emulator in Android Studio or a connected Android device.

For **iOS**: Use an iOS simulator in Xcode or a connected iOS device.

Run the app:

In your terminal: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

`flutter run`

In your IDE: Use the built-in run or debug feature.

6. Observe the App

Once the app starts running, you should see a simple app with an app bar titled "`Hello, Flutter!`" and a center text saying "`Hello, Flutter!`".

7. Experiment with the Code

Try changing the text, style, or layout in the code to see how it affects the app's appearance.
Congratulations on running your first Flutter app! 


**Challenge**

- Create a flutter project called `myapp`. Display your name on screen.
