# Basic Flutter Program

**Steps To Create Flutter Project**

Let’s create a flutter project called first_app. Follow the below steps to create a flutter project.

1. Open command prompt/terminal.
2. Type `flutter create hello` and press enter.
3. Type `cd hello` and press enter.
4. Type `code .` to open project with visual studio code.

*Example 1: Hello World Program*

This is a simple Flutter application that displays Hello World on screen. First, open the `main.dart` file from the lib folder and replace the code with the below code.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text('Hello World!'),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

**Output**


**Basic Flutter Program Explained**

- The `import ‘package:flutter/material.dart’;` means we’re using the Material design package from Flutter.
- The `void main() {…}` function is where every Flutter application starts.
- The `runApp(…);` function is how we initialize and launch the app’s UI.
- The `MaterialApp` widget is our foundation for creating Material Design apps in Flutter.
- The `Scaffold` widget provides a basic visual structure, like a canvas, to design our app upon.
- The `AppBar` widget is like the top bar of an app, where we can place a title or action buttons.
- The `Text` widget is simply for displaying text on the screen.
- The `Center` widget centers the child widget.
