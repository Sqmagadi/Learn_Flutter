# Basic Flutter Program

**Steps To Create Flutter Project**

Let’s create a flutter project called first_app. Follow the below steps to create a flutter project.

1. Open command prompt/terminal.
2. Type `flutter create hello` and press enter.
3. Type `cd hello` and press enter.
4. Type `code .` to open project with visual studio code.

*Example 1: Hello World Program*

This is a simple Flutter application that displays Hello World on screen. First, open the `main.dart` file from the lib folder and replace the code with the below code.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text('Hello World!'),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

**Output**


**Basic Flutter Program Explained**

- The `import ‘package:flutter/material.dart’;` means we’re using the Material design package from Flutter.
- The `void main() {…}` function is where every Flutter application starts.
- The `runApp(…);` function is how we initialize and launch the app’s UI.
- The `MaterialApp` widget is our foundation for creating Material Design apps in Flutter.
- The `Scaffold` widget provides a basic visual structure, like a canvas, to design our app upon.
- The `AppBar` widget is like the top bar of an app, where we can place a title or action buttons.
- The `Text` widget is simply for displaying text on the screen.
- The `Center` widget centers the child widget.

5. Run Flutter Project

To run flutter project, go to run menu and click on Start Debugging or Run Without Debugging. You can also run the project with this command.

`flutter run`

**Challenge**

- Create a flutter project called `myapp`. Display your name on screen.


Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to create a new Flutter project:
bash
Copy code
flutter create my_first_app
Navigate to the new project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd my_first_app
3. Understand the Project Structure
lib/main.dart: This is the main file of your Flutter app. You'll write your app's code here.
pubspec.yaml: This file contains metadata about your app, such as dependencies.
android and ios folders: These folders contain platform-specific code.
4. Write Your First Flutter App
Open lib/main.dart in your IDE.
Replace the existing code with the following code for a simple app:
dart
Copy code
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My First Flutter App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
5. Run the App
Set up an emulator or connect a physical device:
For Android: Use an Android emulator in Android Studio or a connected Android device.
For iOS: Use an iOS simulator in Xcode or a connected iOS device.
Run the app:
In your terminal: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
flutter run
In your IDE: Use the built-in run or debug feature.
6. Observe the App
Once the app starts running, you should see a simple app with an app bar titled "Hello, Flutter!" and a center text saying "Hello, Flutter!".
7. Experiment with the Code
Try changing the text, style, or layout in the code to see how it affects the app's appearance.
Congratulations on running your first Flutter app!
